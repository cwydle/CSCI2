Which sorting method would you recommend and why?
I would recommend the merge sorting method because when dealing with a bigger dataset, the method uses less iteration. For the array size of 10,000,
the selection sorting method uses 50,036,571 iteration whereas the merge sort uses 264,015. The difference in iteration is big. The bigger the iteration, the more time
and memory will be used. That can make or break a company's profits.
